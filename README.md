# Global EEG Norms (GEN)
A Progressive Web Application for Global EEG Norms


## What is GEN?
**GEN** is a Progressive Web App (PWA) for annotating EEG data on the browser.

This software validates the effectiveness of modern web technologies to drastically simplify neuroscience research pipelines through standardized tools available on the Open Web. 

### Additional Details
The contents of file buffers are only decoded and stored in memory when they are needed by the user. Only edited files are then re-encoded on data export.

## GSoC Deliverables
- [ ] A Progressive Web App for loading, annotating and exporting EEG data
- [ ] Documentation website
- [ ] Interrater agreement results from usability testing
- [ ] Automatic detection of common artifacts (optional)
- [ ] Additional features based on end-user requests (optional)
