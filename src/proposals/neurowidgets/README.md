# neurowidgets
Simple web-based tools for interacting with neurophysiology data

## Goals
1. Replicate [NWB Widgets](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb-jupyter-widgets) and, at least partially, [sortingview](https://github.com/magland/sortingview)
2. Allow for safe writing in accordance with the [NWB Inspector](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwbinspector), as well as display of errors in existing files like the [PyNWB validation](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb/blob/dev/src/pynwb/validate.py).
3. Leverage this project to include [WebNWB](https://github.com/brainsatplay/webnwb) as an official API in the Neurodata without Borders ecosystem.
4. Include on [DANDI](https://gui.dandiarchive.org/#/)

## Dependencies
- [WebNWB](https://github.com/brainsatplay/webnwb) is a JavaScript API for working with neurodata stored in the NWB Format
